Database Export Summary
======================
Export Date: 2025-07-30T14:33:59.566Z
Database: CeceLearningPortal

This export contains data from uppercase (PascalCase) tables that were
created by an ASP.NET/Entity Framework application.

These tables are being removed to avoid conflicts with the lowercase
tables used by the Node.js application.

Tables Exported:
- Courses
- CourseModules
- Enrollments
- Subscriptions
- AspNetUsers
- Lessons
- Reviews
- Payments

Note: The data structure is different from the current Node.js schema.
Manual mapping would be required to import this data into the new schema.
